A torrent client to download, stream and cast torrents.

### Features

- **Stream**: 👁 No need to wait for the torrent to download. You can stream the videos inside the app as soon as the torrent starts downloading.
- **Subtitles**: 📖 Automatically load the subtitles if they are present in the torrent.
- **VLC**: You can open any video file in the VLC as soon as it starts downloading.
- **External apps**: 💪 All the files can be opened in the default app on your device.
- **Theme**: 🎨 You can select any color in the preferences panel and the UI will look good in most of them because the whole UI has been designed using opacities.
- **Cast**: 📺 You can cast the video or audio to any chromecast or DLNA enabled device.
- **Music**: 🎶 You can play audio inside the app itself.
